These scripts will be united in one scripts which will contain a function to make a lossy image compression.
The function will have the following structure:
  compression:
    -getting the rgb values from the original picture
    -color space conversion into rgb and color subsampling
    -sorting into 8x8 blocks for the later transform
    -transormation into amplitudes (first with Discrete Fourier Transform, later perhaps with Fast Fourier Transform)
    -quantization (no matrix yet)
    -entropy cofidifn
